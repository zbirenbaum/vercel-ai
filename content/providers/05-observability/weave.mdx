# Weave

[Weave](https://wandb.ai/site/weave) Weave is a toolkit for developing Generative AI applications, built by Weights & Biases.

After integrating with the AI SDK, you can use Weave to trace, monitor, and experiment with LLM providers, prompts and flows.

## Setup

Weave supports [AI SDK telemetry data](/docs/ai-sdk-core/telemetry) through [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/).

You'll need to sign up at https://wandb.ai/site/weave/ to get an API Key.

### Authorization:

1. First obtain your API key from https://wandb.ai/authorize

2. Next, generate your HTTP authorization string by running the following in a terminal:

```bash
echo -n "api:<YOUR_API_KEY>" | base64
```

3. Save this string for the next step. If you would like to copy it into your clipboard you can run the following

Linux: `echo -n "$(echo -n "api:<YOUR_API_KEY>" | base64)" | xclip -sel clipboard`
MacOS: `echo -n "$(echo -n "api:<YOUR_API_KEY>" | base64)" | pbcopy`

### Project ID:

1. Find your wandb entity name under the 'Teams' section on the left side of your wandb [dashboard](https://wandb.ai/home)

2. Choose a name for the project you would like to log your traces to. This may be a new or existing project.

### Next.js

Set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable in your Next.js app's `.env` file with the information from above:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://trace.wandb.ai/otel/v1/traces"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic <STEP_2_AUTH_KEY>,project_id=<YOUR_ENTITY_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>"
```

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on supported AI SDK function calls:

```typescript highlight="7-13"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  prompt: 'What is 2 + 2?',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    metadata: {
      query: 'weather',
      location: 'San Francisco',
    },
  },
});
```
